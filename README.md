🍇 **Analysis on Dates!** 🍇
Aim of this project : Making a fine-tune model, which is ready for deployment using an existing dataset

**Steps involved :** 
- Find out a Dataset, and compare at least two different algorithms and choose the best one
- Use suitable Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection/Engineering Methods
- Fine tune the model and hyper parameters and Finalise the Model
- Make the model deployment-ready by giving User-Input provision
  
Data set used : Date fruit dataset
